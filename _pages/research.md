## Working papers

- *Inequality and Redistribution in the Netherlands*,  
with  Arjan Bruil, Celine van Essen, Wouter Leenders, Arjan Lejour and Jan Mohlmann

    - **Abstract**  
This paper combines detailed administrative records on the universe of the Dutch population with national account aggregates to provide a thorough description of income inequality before and after taxation and income and in-kind transfers in the Netherlands, for the year 2016.  When accounting for domestic and foreign retained earnings, income inequality before transfers stands out, as the last percentile of the income distribution earns 12% of the national income and the last decile 35%.  The tax and transfer system largely reduces income inequality:  the top 10%'s income share falls to 28%.  Inequality reduction is largely driven by benefits, that are targeted at the bottom of the distribution, and much less so by the tax system, which is rather flat overall and even largely regressive at the very top of the income distribution.
