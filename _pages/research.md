- *The Effects of Increasing the Normal Retirement Age: Evidence From the Netherlands*,  
with Tilbe Atav and Egbert Jongen


    - **Abstract**  
    We evaluate the effect of reforms in the social retirement age in the Netherlands (AOW age) on the labour supply and enrollment in social insurance of older workers. The AOW increased stepwise from 65 in 2013 to 65 and 9 months in 2017 (end of the data period). As a result, individuals are subjected to different retirement ages depending on their month of birth. We exploit this variation between birth cohorts using a differences-in-differences approach. Using administrative data from 1999 to 2017 we find that for the affected cohorts the employment rate increases by 16 percentage points during the additional working age months. Furthermore, we find that individuals on unemployment and disability insurance remain in their state longer, but there is hardly any direct substitution towards UI and DI from employment.

- *Tax Evasion in the Netherlands: Evidence from Tax Amnesty Reforms*,  
with Wouter Leenders, Arjan Lejour and Maarten van't Riet


    - **Abstract**  
        Exploiting unique datasets covering over 28,000 tax evaders in the Netherlands, we investigatethe distribution of tax evasion and its implications for the measurement of wealth inequality.In contrast to AlstadsÃ¦ter, Johannesen and Zucman (2019), the correction for offshore wealthhas only a modest effect on top wealth shares. We show that the distributional pattern of taxevasion depends on the type of tax evasion, e.g. it depends on the offshore country of choice. Weexplore a number of explanations to account for the differences in results and caution againstprojecting distributional patterns of detected tax evasion onto still undetected evasion.We also study the dynamic compliance behaviour of tax amnesty participants and documentlarge and sustained increases in reported wealth of around 60% following amnesty participation.Combined with evidence of only a modest increase in the adoption of tax avoidance strategies,this suggests that amnesty participation can lead to substantial public revenue gains.

- *The Child Penalty in the Netherlands and its Determinants*,  
with Sara Rellstab 

    - **Abstract**  
        Having children can result in large earnings penalties for mothers. Using extensive administrative data from the Netherlands, we assess the magnitude and drivers of the effects of first childbirth on parents? earnings trajectories in the Netherlands. We show that mothers? earnings are 46% lower compared to their pre-birth earnings trajectory, whereas fathers? earnings are unaffected by child birth. We examine the role of two potential determinants of the unequal distribution of parents? labour market costs by gender: childcare policies and gender norms. We find that while child care availability is correlated with lower child penalty, the immediate short-term causal effect of increasing child care availability on the earnings penalty of becoming a mother is small. By taking advantage of variation in gender norms in different population groups, we show that gender norms are strongly correlated with child penalty for mothers.
