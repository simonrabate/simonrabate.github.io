- *The Effects of Increasing the Normal Retirement Age: Evidence From the Netherlands*,  
with Tilbe Atav and Egbert Jongen


    - **Abstract**  
    We evaluate the effect of reforms in the social retirement age in the Netherlands (AOW age) on the labour supply and enrollment in social insurance of older workers. The AOW increased stepwise from 65 in 2013 to 65 and 9 months in 2017 (end of the data period). As a result, individuals are subjected to different retirement ages depending on their month of birth. We exploit this variation between birth cohorts using a differences-in-differences approach. Using administrative data from 1999 to 2017 we find that for the affected cohorts the employment rate increases by 16 percentage points during the additional working age months. Furthermore, we find that individuals on unemployment and disability insurance remain in their state longer, but there is hardly any direct substitution towards UI and DI from employment.

- *Tax Evasion in the Netherlands: Evidence from Tax Amnesty Reforms*,  
with Wouter Leenders, Arjan Lejour and Maarten van't Riet


    - **Abstract**  
        Exploiting unique datasets covering over 28,000 tax evaders in the Netherlands, we investigatethe distribution of tax evasion and its implications for the measurement of wealth inequality.In contrast to AlstadsÃ¦ter, Johannesen and Zucman (2019), the correction for offshore wealthhas only a modest effect on top wealth shares. We show that the distributional pattern of taxevasion depends on the type of tax evasion, e.g. it depends on the offshore country of choice. Weexplore a number of explanations to account for the differences in results and caution againstprojecting distributional patterns of detected tax evasion onto still undetected evasion.We also study the dynamic compliance behaviour of tax amnesty participants and documentlarge and sustained increases in reported wealth of around 60% following amnesty participation.Combined with evidence of only a modest increase in the adoption of tax avoidance strategies,this suggests that amnesty participation can lead to substantial public revenue gains.

- *The Child Penalty in the Netherlands and its Determinants*,  
with Sara Rellstab 

    - **Abstract**  
        Having children can result in large earnings penalties for mothers. Using extensive administrative data from the Netherlands, we assess the magnitude and drivers of the effects of first childbirth on parents? earnings trajectories in the Netherlands. We show that mothers? earnings are 46% lower compared to their pre-birth earnings trajectory, whereas fathers? earnings are unaffected by child birth. We examine the role of two potential determinants of the unequal distribution of parents? labour market costs by gender: childcare policies and gender norms. We find that while child care availability is correlated with lower child penalty, the immediate short-term causal effect of increasing child care availability on the earnings penalty of becoming a mother is small. By taking advantage of variation in gender norms in different population groups, we show that gender norms are strongly correlated with child penalty for mothers.

- *Labor Supply Effects of Survivor Insurance:  Evidence From a Benefit Cut in the Netherlands*,  
with Julie Tréguier 

    - **Abstract**  
 This paper investigates the effects of survivors' benefits (SB) on labor supply responses. We use rich administrative data on the universe of Dutch residents, and exploit the 1996 Dutch reform that considerably tightened eligibility rules to  causally identify the labor supply effect of SB.We use a regression discontinuity approach, using the cohort-based implementation of the reform. We show that, following the tightening of SB eligibility, individual income and labor force participation after spousal death increase significantly (+23% and 16% respectively).  We further decompose those effects and show that the widows who entered the labor market due to the reform mainly did so in the care sector, and that already working widows increased their number of working hours by 8%. We also find evidence of active substitution of widows toward disability insurance as a result of the reform. Finally, our heterogeneity results suggest that the magnitude of the response to the reform depends on widows' ability to self-insure against the risk of spousal death.

- *Inequality and Redistribution in the Netherlands*,  
with  Arjan Bruil, Celine van Essen, Wouter Leenders, Arjan Lejour and Jan Mohlmann

    - **Abstract**  
This paper combines detailed administrative records on the universe of the Dutch population with national account aggregates to provide a thorough description of income inequality before and after taxation and income and in-kind transfers in the Netherlands, for the year2016.  When accounting for domestic and foreign retained earnings, income inequality before transfers stands out, as the last percentile of the income distribution earns 12% of the national income and the last decile 35%.  The tax and transfer system largely reduces income inequality:  the top 10%?s income share falls to 28%.  Inequality reduction is largely driven by benefits, that are targeted at the bottom of the distribution, and much less so by the tax system, which is rather flat overall and even largely regressive at the very top of the income distribution.

- *The impact of import competition and export opportunities on the Dutch labour market*,  
with  Rob Euwals, Gerrit Hugo van Heuvelen, Gerdien Meijerink and Jan Möhlmann

    - **Abstract**  
We study the impact of rising Chinese and Eastern European import competition and export opportunities between 2001 and 2016 on the Dutch labour market. Both the participation of China in the WTO and the extension of the European Union provide an opportunity to investigate the impact of an unanticipated increase in trade on 40 Dutch COROP regions. We do not find a robust impact of the increase in trade on local employment, wages and inequality. The results do not imply that trade does not have an impact on Dutch regions, but the effects might play out in a more complicated way. Results for the Netherlands as well as other countries can be explained by the initial composition of the employment share across industries and the labour institutions.
